Users
Unix-like systems (like the one you're using) support multiple users. Each user has their own home directory, their own files, and their own permissions.

If you're like most people these days, you're the only user on your machine. It used to be more common for multiple people to share a single computer, or for multiple people to do their work on the same computer over a network.

Sudo
The sudo keyword lets you run a command as a "superuser". It's short for "superuser do". To use it, you'll need a password with superuser privileges, which you should already have if you're the only user of your machine.

Some people are pedantic and pronounce sudo as "sue-doo". Others are correct and pronounce it "sue-dough".

Note: sudo grants unrestricted access and can risk system damage if you don't know what you're doing. All commands in this course are safe, but other commands should be reviewed before running with sudo.

Assignment
Run the "Who am I?" command to see which user you're logged in as:
whoami

Run the same command as root:
sudo whoami

You'll be prompted for your password. Enter it. Copy and paste the output of the command into the input box and submit your answer.
