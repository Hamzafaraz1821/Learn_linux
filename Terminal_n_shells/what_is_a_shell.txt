What Is a Shell?
So if your terminal is just a program that lets you issue text-based commands and renders the output of those commands...

...What is the program that runs those commands???

That's a shell.

Shells do a lot of things, but their main job is to interpret the commands you type and execute them.

REPL
Shells are often referred to as "REPL"s. REPL stands for

Read
Eval (evaluate)
Print
Loop
This is a fancy way of saying that shells are programs that:

Read the commands you type
Evaluate those commands, usually by running other programs on your computer
Print the output of those commands
Give you a new prompt to type another command and repeat
Assignment
In your own shell, run the following command:

expr 123456 + 7890
Copy icon
Note: If you're on Windows, use your WSL Ubuntu shell for this and all future lessons.

Paste the output of that command into the text box on the right.

Tip
If you're confused about prompts vs outputs, here's a quick explanation.

wagslane@MacBook-Pro ~ % echo hello
hello
wagslane@MacBook-Pro ~ %
Copy icon
In the example above, I started with an empty prompt and typed echo hello and pressed enter.

wagslane@MacBook-Pro ~ % echo hello
Copy icon
The shell ran that command, and printed the output:

hello
Copy icon
Finally, it gave me a new prompt to type another command:

wagslane@MacBook-Pro ~ %
