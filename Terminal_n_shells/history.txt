History
When you're working in a REPL, it's really helpful to be able to see the commands you've typed in the past. That way you can easily re-run them, or copy and paste them into a script. To print out the history of commands you've typed in your shell, you can use the history command.

history

Assignment
In your shell, set 2 variables:

Use echo to print the following message (using the $department and $team variables):

Run the history command, and paste its output into the text field.
