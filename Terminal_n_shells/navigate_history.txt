Navigate History
You'll often want to re-run a command. You could just type it out again, but assuming you don't have the WPM of ThePrimeagen, that's a pain.

Arrow Keys
You can use the up and down arrows to quickly cycle through your command history.

Focus your terminal window and use the "up" arrow key to start cycling through your command history. If you recently restarted your shell, then first type a few commands first, like:

echo hello
echo world
Copy icon
Once you've cycled back through your history with the "up" arrow, you can use the "down" arrow to cycle back to the most recent command.

Clear
If your terminal is feeling cluttered with text, you can clear it with the clear command, or by pressing ctrl + l.

This won't delete your history, it will just clear the screen.
