head and tail
Sometimes you don't want to print everything in a file. Files can be really big after all.

The head Command
The head command prints the first n lines of a file, where n is a number you specify.

head -n 10 file1.txt
Copy icon
If you don't specify a number, it will default to 10.

The tail Command
The tail command prints the last n lines of a file, where n is a number you specify.

tail -n 10 file1.txt
Copy icon
Assignment
Time to start investigating the bank's transactions.

Use the cd command to get into the worldbanc/private/transactions/ directory.
Run the cat command to view the contents of the 2023.csv file. You'll notice that it's a really long file. We don't want to print the whole thing.
Use the head command to print the first 6 lines of the 2023.csv file and copy them into the input field â€“ do not submit yet
We print the first 6 lines because the first line in the file is the header, and we want to include that along with the first 5 transactions.

Use the tail command to print the last 5 lines of the 2023.csv file and copy them into the input field
Submit the combined first 6 and last 5 lines, for a total of 11 lines.

Tip
Remember, you can use .. as an alias for a parent directory. So if you're in worldbanc/private/transactions/ and you want to get to worldbanc, you can run cd .. twice:

cd ..
cd ..

Alternatively, you can just run:

cd ../..
Copy icon
once.
