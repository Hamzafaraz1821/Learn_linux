Move
The move command moves a file or directory from one location to another. You can use it to rename a file or to move it to a different directory altogether. Your working directory can't be the directory you're moving.

Renaming a file:

mv some_file.txt some_other_name.txt
Copy icon
Moving a file from the current directory to another nested directory:

mv some_file.txt some_directory/some_file.txt
Copy icon
Moving a file from the current directory, to the parent directory:

mv some_file.txt ../some_file.txt
Copy icon
If you don't want to rename the file and you're just moving it to a different directory, you can omit the filename:

mv some_file.txt some_directory/
Copy icon
Assignment
Move the tbills.txt file from worldbanc/public/products/credit_cards/tbills.txt, into the new worldbanc/public/products/investments directory. Keep the filename the same.

List the contents of the investments directory and paste the output into the text field and submit your answer.

Tip
Both the target and destination have to be valid paths from the current working directory. Use pwd to see where you are and adjust the source and destination paths accordingly. Use ls to verify that the file has been moved correctly. If you mess up the mv command, you'll need to figure out where you accidentally moved the file to, then move it from that location back to where it belongs.
