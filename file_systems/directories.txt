During your digging, you find that a file appears to be out of place!

Make sure you're in the worldbanc/public/products/credit_cards directory
Run ls from there. You should see a file called tbills.txt. Treasury Bills (T-Bills) are a type of investment, not a credit card!
Go back to the products directory and create a new directory called "investments".
List the contents of the products directory again to confirm that the new directory was created.
Paste the contents of the products directory into the input field and submit it.
