Touch
The touch command updates the access and modification timestamps of a file. By default, if the specified file does not exist, touch will create an empty file with the given filename. Because of this side-effect, youâ€™ll often see this command used to quickly create new empty files.

touch new_file.txt
Copy icon
You can also create multiple files at once by listing them:

touch some_file.txt some_other_file.txt
Copy icon
touch can be very handy when writing scripts because it ensures files exist without altering existing ones, creating new files only if necessary.
