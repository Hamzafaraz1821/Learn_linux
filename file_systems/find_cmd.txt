Find
The find command is a powerful tool for finding files and directories by name, not by their contents.

Find a File by Name
Let's say you're looking for a file named hello.txt somewhere in your home directory. You can use the find command to search for exactly that title:

find some_directory -name hello.txt
Copy icon
Pattern Search
The find command can also search for files that match a pattern. For example, if you wanted to find all files that end in .txt, you could run:

find some_directory -name "*.txt"
Copy icon
The * character is a wildcard that matches anything. If you're trying to find filenames that contain a specific word, you can use the * character to match the rest of the filename:

# Find all filenames that contain the word "chad"
find some_directory -name "*chad*"
Copy icon
Assignment
You've been tipped off that fraudulent activity seems to happen often with "joint" accounts. "joint" means accounts that have more than one owner.

Use the find command to search the worldbanc/public/products directory for all files that contain the word "joint" in their name.

Paste the output of your find command into the input field and submit it.
