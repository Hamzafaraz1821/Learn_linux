Files
You're probably familiar with the concept of files from using a GUI like Windows Explorer or Finder.

At their core, files are just blobs of data. The raw bytes in a file can represent anything: text, images, videos, etc.

The cat Command
The cat command is used to view the contents of a file. It's short for "concatenate", which is a fancy way of saying "put things together". It can feel like a confusing name if you're using the cat command to view a single file, but it makes more sense when you're using it to view multiple files at once.

# Print the contents of a file to the terminal
cat file1.txt
Copy icon
# Concatenate the contents of multiple files and print them to the terminal
cat file1.txt file2.txt
Copy icon
