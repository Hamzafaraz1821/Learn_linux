Assignment
Take a look inside the worldbanc/private/transactions/ directory. You should see a few files containing transactions from different years.
Look inside the backups directory inside of transactions. It looks like something is missing!
Copy the missing file from the transactions directory into the backups directory so there is a backup of all of the transactions.
List the contents of the backups directory and paste the output into the input field and submit it.
