Remove
The remove command deletes a file or empty directory:

rm some_file.txt
Copy icon
You can optionally add a -r flag to tell the rm command to delete a directory and all of its contents recursively. "Recursively" is just a fancy way of saying "do it again on all of the subdirectories and their contents".

rm -r some_directory
Copy icon
Assignment
Change directories to the worldbanc/private directory using the cd command.
Use the cat command to view the contents of the worldbanc/private/passwords/passwords.txt file.
There's a big problem here! It looks like someone is storing passwords in plain text! Even on a private machine, this is a big security risk.

Delete both the passwords directory and the passwords.txt file within it.
List the contents of the "private" directory again to make sure that the file is gone.
Paste the contents of the private directory into the input field and submit it.
