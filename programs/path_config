PATH Config
In the last lesson, you changed your PATH variable for your current shell session. Trouble is, the next time you restart your shell, it will be reset to its default value. You won't be able to use the worldbanc.sh CLI Tool from anywhere unless you change your PATH variable permanently.

The most common way to do this is to add the same export command that you used in the last lesson to your shell's configuration file.

Assignment
Edit your .zshrc / .bashrc file (whatever your shell config file is) and add an export command to the end of the file that adds the worldbanc/private/bin directory to your PATH variable.
Restart your shell session.
Run the worldbanc.sh CLI tool again from your home directory and make sure it works.
