Positional Arguments
Programming languages have functions, and functions take arguments. For example, this Python function takes two arguments: xp and level:

def print_player(xp, level):
    print("Player has", xp, "xp and is level", level)
Copy icon
It can then be called with two arguments:

print_player(100, 2)
# Player has 100 xp and is level 2
Copy icon
In a shell, commands (programs) can also take arguments. For example, the cd command takes a single argument (the directory to change to):

cd /home/wagslane
Copy icon
Other commands might take multiple arguments. For example, the mv command takes two arguments: the file to move, and the destination to move it to:

mv file.txt newfile.txt
Copy icon
Assignment
Take a look inside the worldbanc/public directory. cat the contents of the suspicious-looking key.txt file. This looks like some kind of private key... why is it in the public directory?
Move it from worldbanc/public/key.txt file to worldbanc/private/.
List the contents of the worldbanc/private directory
