Flags
As you've already seen in this course, some commands accept flags. Flags are options that you can pass to a command to change its behavior.

For example, the ls command can take a -l flag to show a "long" listing of files:

ls -l
Copy icon
Or the -a flag to show "all" files, including hidden files:

ls -a
Copy icon
You can also combine flags:

ls -al
Copy icon
Conventions
Whether or not a command takes flags, and what those flags are, is up to the developer of the command. That said there are some common conventions:

Single-character flags are prefixed with a single dash (.e.g -a)
Multi-character flags are prefixed with two dashes (e.g. --help)
Sometimes the same flag can be used with a single dash or two dashes (e.g. -h or --help)
Assignment
You've found that some files have been tampered with! To figure out which one it is, you need to know the number of bytes contained in each file.

Use the "word count" command, wc, to count the number of bytes in the worldbanc/public/pr_ideas.txt file. Use the man command to figure out which flag you need to use.
