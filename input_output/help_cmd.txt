Help
By convention, most production-ready CLI tools have a "help" option that prints information about how to use the tool. It's usually accessed with one of the following:

--help (flag)
-h (flag)
help (first positional argument)
The "help" output is often easier to parse than a full man page. It's usually more of a quick start guide than a full manual.

Assignment
You need to make some network requests as part of this audit: you want to make sure that this machine you're auditing only has access to authorized systems.

To make those requests, you'll need to know how to use curl. It's a cli tool that lets you make network requests from the command line.

Print out the help menu for curl.
